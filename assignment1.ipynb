The filter would then exclude such works which may sometimes be highly niche that results in the lower citation count. Secondly, filtering of <10 authors could potentially exclude works that were done by a large team. It could have been a complex topic that required a large team to collaborate on, which would still be relevant to the field but are excluded due to such filters."
